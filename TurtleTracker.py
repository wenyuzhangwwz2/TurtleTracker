# Create a variable pointing to the file with no header
fileName = "V:\Lab5\Scripting3\SaraNoHeader.txt"

# Open the file as a read-only file object
fileObj = open(fileName, 'r')

# Read the first line from the open file object
lineString = fileObj.readline()

# Close the file object
fileObj.close()

# Use the split command to parse the items in lineString into a list object
lineData = lineString.split("\t")

# Assign variables to specfic items in the list
recordID = lineData[0]              # ARGOS tracking record ID
obsDateTime = lineData[2]           # Observation date and time (combined)
obsDate = obsDateTime.split()[0]    # Observation date - first item in obsDateTime list object
obsTime = obsDateTime.split()[1]    # Observation time - second item in obsDateTime list object
obsLC = lineData[3]                 # Observation Location Class
obsLat = lineData[5]                # Observation Latitude
obsLon = lineData[6]                # Observation Longitude

# Print information to the user
print "According to record " + recordID, 
print "Sara was seen at " + obsLat + " d LAT; " + obsLat + " d LON on " + obsDate
